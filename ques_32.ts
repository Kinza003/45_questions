/* Do the following to create a program that stimulates 
how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
路 Make a list of 5 or more usernames called current_user.
路 Make another list of 5 usernames calles new_users. Make
  sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
路 Loop through the new_user list to see if each new username has 
  already been used. If it has, print the message that the person will need 
  to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print the message 
  saying that the username is available. 
路 Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used 'JOHN' 
  could not be accepted. */
